# webscraping_indexing


## Installing
To run the code, you first need to clone the repository.
```
git clone https://github.com/abdelrahim-hentabli/webscraping_indexing.git
```

## Compiling and Running
To compile on a linux system, change to the main directory and run the compile.sh file. You may need to give it execute permission with
```
chmod +x compile.sh
```
You need to export a PATH_TO_LUCENE variable for the compile to run correctly
```
export PATH_TO_LUCNE=<your path to lucene>
```
This needs to be done each time you re-open your terminal, or you can put it in your .bashrc/.zshrc
